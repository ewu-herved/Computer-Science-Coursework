CSCD 300: Lab 4

The Test_Postfix java file takes a .txt file as input and reads it line
by line. If it encounters an integer, it will store it on the stack
using a link list implementation. When it encounters an operator, it
will pop the operator and the most recent integers on the stack and 
complete the operation. It will put the result back onto the stack. If
there are more lines to be read it will continue, otherwise it will 
print the result.
