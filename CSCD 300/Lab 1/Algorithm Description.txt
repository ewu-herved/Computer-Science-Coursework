The modified algorithm for binary search considers an array twice, 
first to discover the left boundary of the element being searched for,
and then the right boundary for the same element. In both cases it 
continues to cut the sample in half, checking either that the low and 
high indicies are equal to one another and the given element, or that 
low and high are adjacent and one is the given element and the other is
not. If either of these conditions is met, element identified within 
these parameters is identified as being either the leftmost or
rightmost boundary of the given element within the array.
