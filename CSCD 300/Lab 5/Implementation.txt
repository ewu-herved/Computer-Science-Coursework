Node.java:

Basic node class for use by LinkedList.java. Includes Node next and 
Comparable data as it's private data fields.

ListQueue.java:

Singly-linked list with a dummy head node and a tail node. Enqueues
the dequeued data from the ArrayLists in ascending order.

ArrayQueue.java:

Data from the files is stored in these size 10 arrays. There exists an
array for every file given. When all of the arrays are at capacity, 
they will dequeue the smallest head value among them until they are 
all empty. They will then receive data from the files once more. This 
will continue until the files have been entirely run through and the
ArrayLists are empty. 

Test_Merge.java:

This is the driver class. It will take any number of filename arguments
from the console and attempt to put them in a dynamic Scanner array. 
It will then input the data from these files into ArrayQueues and
combine these into one ListQueue. Finally, it will dequeue the ListQueue
and print the results.
